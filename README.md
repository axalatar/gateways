## Gateways

Gateways is a Minecraft mod which adds gateways you can teleport around with. It adds the following features:

- Gateway hub
    - Crafted with four chorus flowers, four amethyst blocks, and an eye of ender
    - Each hub has a frequency, and stores a destination frequency
    - Hubs are the center of gateways. A gateway is formed by placing a hub in the center of a square of amethyst (or resonant amethyst) blocks. Gateways can be up to a 7x7 square
    - Upon right-clicking, the eye of the block will open if the pad and the pad to be teleported to are both valid. On the next right-click, all the blocks and entities on the pad will be teleported
    - When it teleports, there are some cool particles and a really fancy flash animation on both sides
- Tuning fork
    - Crafted with a copper ingot and iron bars
    - When you shift right-click on a hub, it tunes the tuning fork to that hub's frequency
    - When you right click a hub with a tuned tuning fork, it gives the hub the frequency
- Resonant amethyst
    - Crafted with two amethyst blocks and two glowstone dust
    - Works the same as amethyst, is valid for gateway pads
    - When right-clicked with a tuned tuning fork, propagates the frequency through it to any connected hubs
- Cracked amethyst / cracked resonant amethyst
    - When a gateway teleports, it turns some of its amethyst or resonant amethyst into their cracked variants
    - It can be fixed by either:
        - Right clicking it with an amethyst shard
        - Throwing an amethyst shard on top of it
        - Throwing an amethyst shard on the ground nearby, and throwing a bottle of exp on it. Consumes the exp, but can fix multiple cracked blocks
- Resonance conduit
    - Crafted with two polished basalt and a resonant amethyst
    - Stores a tuning fork
    - When powered from below, propagates a frequency downward (directly to a hub or to a hub connected through resonant amethyst)
